I decided to use Hashmap that holds array of both normalized and unnormalized brightnesses for
SubImgCharMatcher in order to minimize time complexity to find a specific brightness for char
and to update it.

I also decided to renormalize brightness values only if the minimum/maximum brightness has been changed
(removed or added).

When it comes to the algorithm, unfortunately I can't say the same as I've been in a rush to finish the
project (and the README) in time, due to illness, so I have decided to go with the naive solution.

For exceptions I created an exceptions class in Shell that prints relevant error messages according to the
exception type (Resolution/Add/Remove/Image).

UML is attached.
